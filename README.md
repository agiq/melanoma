# Abstract

There are over 200 different cancer. Melanoma is one of the deadliest skin cancers.

The diagnostic procedure for melanoma begins with a clinical exam to evaluate your skin for any new changes, followed by a dermatoscope to look for changes in your skin, and then a biopsy to confirm if it is indeed cancer.

Skin cancer is curable if it’s diagnosed early and treated effectively.

The first step of melanoma skin cancer diagnosis is to look for suspicious changes in your skin, such as new or changing moles, a change in your skin’s texture, or any other changes.

Dermatologists use the high-speed video imaging system that takes the images of the skin lesions by the high-speed camera, which has an accuracy of 65-80% in the melanoma diagnosis with no additional technical support.

The overall prediction rate of melanoma diagnoses has increased by 12%, thanks to further visual inspection by cancer treatment specialists and images of melanomas taken using dermatoscopy, a new technology which improves the appearance and clarity of the skin’

# Problem statement

To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.

The data set contains the following diseases:

Actinic keratosis
Basal cell carcinoma
Dermatofibroma
Melanoma
Nevus
Pigmented benign keratosis
Seborrheic keratosis
Squamous cell carcinoma
Vascular lesion

# Dataset

The dataset consists of 2239 train and 118 test images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images.
